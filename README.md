For the 8th week assignment at Üretken Akademi Mega Software Academy, I've decided to work on my second project. I've upgraded the project I initially created using JavaScript by utilizing ReactJS technology. In addition to this project:

⭐ React and Ant Design: I've learned how to use React and Ant Design to create user-friendly interfaces.

⭐ Cart Operations: I've learned how to implement shopping cart operations like adding/removing products and completing orders.

⭐ Product and Category Management: I've learned how to create products and categories myself.

Additionally, in this project:

⭐ React Usage: Developed with the React library, this project boasts a modular and manageable structure due to its component-based nature.
⭐ React Router Dom: React Router Dom was used to manage page transitions, enabling seamless navigation between different pages and facilitating URL-based redirection.
⭐ Bootstrap Utilization: Bootstrap was employed in the project to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
⭐ useState and useEffect: React hooks like useState and useEffect were utilized for managing user interactions and tracking component lifecycles.
⭐ HTML and CSS: HTML and CSS were employed for designing the interface and improving user experience.
